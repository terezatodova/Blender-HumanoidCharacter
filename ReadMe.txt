3D Character modelling

The base idea for the character
- a young adult female, half harpie half human
- retains some of her harpie features 
 	- such as the deformed legs with pointy heels, the pointy fingers and nails
 	- also the colouring of her body, especially the arms and the legs
 	- the piercing blue eyes, with enhanced sight compared to an ordinary human
 	- last but not least the feathers on her back, which are a reminiscent of beautiful harpie wings
 	- the initial idea was to create the feathers using particle editing
 		- this was scrapped when I started working with hair in general - unfortunately blender lagged whenever I combed the hair and the amount of
 		polygons and particles made it impossible to create the feathers individually
 		- I opted for drawing the feathers by using different heights in substance painter and coloring them
 		(the texture is currently set to the resolution 2048x2048 - a higher resolution crashed and was impossible to work with, leading to less details)
- the rest of her body is humanoid with classic female features

- the ground used for rendering was created in my previous project for 3D modelling - robots
- all renders are supposed to resemble a simple desert with a "fantasy" sky, simulating her return to live with the harpies after being rejected from the human worlds
